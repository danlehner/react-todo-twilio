# Todo app with Express server and Twilio integration

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), running on an Express server integrated with Twilio. This mini-app is meant to be a sort of "proof of concept" for a feature in the future refactoring (MEN stack -> MERN stack) of my [Track Meet](https://github.com/danlehner/trackmeet) app - a way to use Twilio to send a list of the Track Meet user's "currently unlistened-to songs" in the form of an SMS message. 

## Using the app 

1. Use the input bar to enter to-do's into the list
2. Enter your phone number (in the correct formatting) to receive an SMS message of your current to-do list!

## Technologies used

1. React.js
2. CSS
3. Twilio API
